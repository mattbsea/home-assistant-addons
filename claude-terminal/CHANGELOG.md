# Changelog

## 1.21.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Persistent `/home/claude` directory**: `/home/claude` is now symlinked to `/data/home` at startup, so all files in the home directory survive container restarts
- **`/home/claude` as default working directory**: Dockerfile `WORKDIR` and runtime `HOME` are both set to `/home/claude`, giving a consistent and intuitive working location

## 1.20.1

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed non-root user file ownership**: `chown -R claude:claude /data` now runs after all files are created in `init_environment()`, so symlinks, tmux config, and migrated auth files are all owned by the `claude` user
- **Fixed Claude binary access**: Claude Code is now installed as the `claude` user during the Docker build so all supporting files in `~/.local/` are owned by uid 1000 and accessible at runtime

## 1.20.0

### 🔒 Security
- **Run as non-root user**: The terminal process (ttyd, bash, Claude) now runs as an unprivileged `claude` user (uid/gid 1000) instead of root
  - `gosu` performs a clean privilege drop after startup tasks (apt installs, dir setup) complete as root
  - `/data` directory ownership transferred to the `claude` user on startup
  - Claude binary made world-executable so the non-root user can invoke it

## 1.19.1

### 🐛 Bug Fix
- **Fixed `claude_args` not being passed to Claude**: Single quotes in the tmux command prevented shell variable expansion, so configured arguments were silently ignored. Args are now embedded directly into the command string.

## 1.9.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Claude CLI arguments**: New `claude_args` configuration option lets you pass extra command-line flags to Claude on every launch (e.g. `--model claude-opus-4-5`, `--verbose`)
  - Works with both auto-launch mode and all session picker options (new, continue, resume)
  - Leave blank for default behaviour

### 🔒 Security
- **Data-only volume mount**: The add-on no longer mounts the Home Assistant `/config` folder
  - Only the add-on's own `/data` directory is mounted, preventing unintended access to HA configuration files
  - Working directory changed from `/config` to `/data`

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- `ttyd` is now installed at build time from the official GitHub release binary (was failing at runtime because `ttyd` is not in Debian apt repositories)
- `CLAUDE_ARGS` environment variable propagated from `run.sh` into the session picker so all launch paths respect the configured arguments

## 1.8.0

### 🔄 Breaking Change - Switched from Alpine to Debian
- **Base image changed to Debian 12 (bookworm)**: Resolves incompatibility between Claude Code CLI and Alpine's musl libc
  - Claude Code requires glibc, which is provided by Debian but not Alpine (musl)
  - All three architectures updated: amd64, aarch64, armv7
- **`persistent_apk_packages` renamed to `persistent_apt_packages`**: Update your add-on configuration if you use this option
  - `persist-install apk` command renamed to `persist-install apt`
  - All package management now uses `apt-get` instead of `apk`

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- `apt-get` replaces `apk` for all package installation
- Python packages renamed to Debian conventions (e.g. `py3-pip` → `python3-pip`)
- `yq` installed as a pre-built binary (mikefarah/yq) for multi-arch compatibility
- Persistent packages JSON config key changed from `apk_packages` to `apt_packages`

### 📦 Migration Guide
If you have `persistent_apk_packages` set in your add-on configuration, rename it to `persistent_apt_packages`. Package names remain the same — most Alpine package names have direct apt equivalents.

```yaml
# Before
persistent_apk_packages:
  - vim
  - htop

# After
persistent_apt_packages:
  - vim
  - htop
```

## 1.7.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Session Persistence with tmux** (#46): Claude sessions now survive browser navigation
  - Sessions persist when navigating away from the terminal in Home Assistant
  - New "Reconnect to existing session" option in session picker (option 0)
  - Seamless session resumption - conversations continue exactly where you left off
  - tmux integration provides robust session management
  - Contributed by [@petterl](https://github.com/petterl)

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- Added tmux package to container
- Custom tmux configuration optimized for web terminals:
  - Mouse mode intelligently disabled when using ttyd (prevents conflicts)
  - OSC 52 clipboard support for copy/paste to browser
  - 50,000 line history buffer for extensive scrollback
  - Vi-style keybindings in copy mode
  - Visual improvements with better status bar
- Session picker enhanced with reconnection logic
- Automatic session cleanup and management

### 🎯 User Experience
- No more lost work when switching between Home Assistant pages
- Browser refresh no longer interrupts Claude conversations
- Tab switching preserves full session state including history
- Improved reliability for long-running Claude sessions

## 1.6.1

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Native Install Path Mismatch
- **Fixed "installMethod is native, but directory does not exist" error**: Claude binary now available at `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` at runtime
  - **Root cause**: Native installer places Claude at `/root/.local/bin/claude` during Docker build, but at runtime `HOME=/data/home`, so Claude's self-check looks in `/data/home/.local/bin/claude` which didn't exist
  - **Solution**: Symlink created from `/data/home/.local/bin/claude` → `/root/.local/bin/claude` on startup
  - **Result**: Claude native binary resolves correctly regardless of HOME directory change
  - Ref: [ESJavadex/claude-code-ha#3](https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-code-ha/issues/3)

## 1.6.0 - 2026-01-26

### 🔄 Changed
- **Native Claude Code Installation**: Switched from npm package to official native installer
  - Uses `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` instead of `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - Native binary provides automatic background updates from Anthropic
  - Faster startup (no Node.js interpreter overhead)
  - Claude binary symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/claude` for easy access
- **Simplified execution**: All scripts now call `claude` directly instead of `node $(which claude)`
- **Cleaner Dockerfile**: Removed npm retry/timeout configuration (no longer needed)

### 📦 Notes
- Node.js and npm remain available as development tools
- Existing authentication and configuration files are unaffected

## 1.5.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Persistent Package Management** (#32): Install APK and pip packages that survive container restarts
  - New `persist-install` command for installing packages from the terminal
  - Configuration options: `persistent_apk_packages` and `persistent_pip_packages`
  - Packages installed via command or config are automatically reinstalled on startup
  - Supports both Home Assistant add-on config and local state file
  - Inspired by community contribution from [@ESJavadex](https://github.com/ESJavadex)

### 📦 Usage Examples
```bash
# Install APK packages persistently
persist-install apk vim htop

# Install pip packages persistently
persist-install pip requests pandas numpy

# List all persistent packages
persist-install list

# Remove from persistence (package remains until restart)
persist-install remove apk vim
```

### 🛠️ Configuration
Add to your add-on config to auto-install packages:
```yaml
persistent_apk_packages:
  - vim
  - htop
persistent_pip_packages:
  - requests
  - pandas
```
